Week 1:

ALREADY DONE:
-connect to api data from etherscan and extract top 100 holders for 25 choosen coins
-all coin adresses excel file with all adresses data 
-coin adresses excel with adresses and daily update token balance
-daily writer in every excel algo - needs to be done manually 



IMPORTANT:
###must verify analyze.py get function value, think too large number divisision
###ocean looks to be a problem 

-trade size indicator among top 100 holders by time frame(1, 3, 7, 21 days) - gets number of transactions divided on brice basis of transaction

-algo that tracks price vs fundamental analysis holders
  -try using linear regression/ ai/ ml
  -implement panda data analysis for excel

-python api for coin average price per day / excel w price everyday? or get the price for a specific day 

-fix and find solution in case api error from etherscan!!!



ALSO:
-host on replit server
